        <h1 class="title">about us</h1>
        <p class="bio">The story began in the 1990s when five friends with a shared passion for music decided to create
            a band that would push the boundaries of rock and soul. Tyler, a virtuoso on the bass guitar, provided the
            band's rock-solid foundation. Carson, with his electrifying guitar skills, added the searing riffs and
            soulful melodies that would become Kangaroo Kourt's signature sound. Mikey's dynamic drumming brought an
            irresistible groove, while Tate's powerful vocals and charismatic stage presence elevated the band to a
            whole new level. Ben, the keyboard maestro, contributed lush textures and soulful harmonies that completed
            the ensemble.

        <p class="bio">Kangaroo Kourt spent countless hours honing their craft, drawing inspiration from the rich
            musical history of Indiana and beyond. They seamlessly blended the raw energy of rock with the emotional
            depth of soul, creating a sound that was uniquely their own. Their lyrics were introspective and
            thought-provoking, touching on themes of love, loss, and the human experience.

        <p class="bio">After years of playing in local venues and building a dedicated fan base (styled "The Joeys"),
            Kangaroo Kourt's breakthrough came with their debut album, ‚ÄúSunday Best,‚Äù released in 2023 to critical
            acclaim and a decisive ‚Äúfresh‚Äù from Rotten Tomatoes. The album featured hits like ‚ÄúKiss The Water‚Äù and
            ‚ÄúThink Of Me High,‚Äù which catapulted them into the national spotlight. Their electrifying live performances
            became legendary, drawing fans from all over the country to witness the magic of Kangaroo Kourt.

            them going.
